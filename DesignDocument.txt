This is the semi-official vision for FanReader and how it will work.

It will be separated into components:

A Fetcher, that downloads the story from its respective site, along with whatever metadata (usually tags) that may be provided.
The Fetcher Will:
- Create an object of the Story Class, and store it on disk.
- Fill the Story Object with Objects of the Chapter Class, that will be the primary focal point of the program.
- All of this will be stored on disk, based on user settings of course.

A Snipetter, that will clean the Chapter Objects into Objects of the Snippet Class.
The Snipetter will:
- Fill the chapter objects with snippet objects.
- The snippet objects will contain the active character, emotional tone, etc.

The Snippet Objects will be able to self-analyse to a certain extent, but will be able to, via the Chapter Object,
ask adjacent snippets in the timeline for information as well.
